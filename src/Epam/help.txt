This is a help document for my console.
It's still young and can't do something really awesome, but I'm still proud of it.
Hope it'll be helpful for you.

List of commands and their annotation:

Usage

There's not so much to tell bout this command. Exit from console.

- copy
Usage
copy [name] [path_to] [-r; --anyway]

- move
Usage
